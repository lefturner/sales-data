#Take-Rate Analysis in New Home Construction by Model & Series Type
####This data comes from a local home builder transitioning from a custom builder to semi-production. In doing so, it has become increasingly important to understand option take-rates, so that only options with 20% take-rates are sold. This is due to the overhead involved with supporting multiple options and the increasing complexity for sales, construction, and database management.<BR>
####The analysis of this project is a sub-project of a larger undertaking to evaluate all options sold over time. The scope of this project only extends to the foundation types purchased by homeowners over the course of data collection period (2016 to 2019).<BR>
####In order to do this, I started by first separating the series types; there are two series: Patriotic and Garden. All Patriotic homes come with the same foundation type, so there is no analysis needed. Garden Homes, however, come with a variety of options. <BR>
####Next, I used Matplotlib to display the foundation results in a pie chart across all home types to draw a conclusion on which foundation types should be discontinued due to take-rates under 20%.
